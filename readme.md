# Fresh Tomatoes
Fresh Tomatoes generates an HTML website with movie titles, box art, and trailer videos using Python.

### Requirements
You will need to have Python 3 installed (available free at python.org) to generate the website and an internet connection to see the movie art and trailers.

### Getting Started
To begin, make sure that all 3 Python files (fresh_tomatoes, media, and entertainment_center) are in the same directory as each other. Then simply run entertainment_center.py and it will generate and open an HTML file called fresh_tomatoes.html in that same directory.
